# Nathanism

I am so sorry what I am about to put you through. But this is what happens when you are in a quarantine. So sorry not sorry. This website probably stinks of my sense of humour but hopefully there is some gold at the end of the rainbrow. Also thank you for being born to make this creative spark inside me for wanting to learn. Even for strange reasons. 

How to use:
1. Open the Index.html with chrome or etc.
2. Enjoy! Or something else...
3. Don't bother with any other file and also don't delete them because you will break everything
4. Pls don't :-(

Warning: You will need to use the internet to correctly use the website (I know duh) but some images use URLs.

P.s. there is a back button above the title on the Nathan cool website if you want to go back to the index and also if you want to find a cheeky easter egg look through the code by pressing ctrl + shift + i. Also some text when hovering over texts to be spotted.

If there is any bugs with the website please inform me, it would really help me but hopefully not.
